Collidy Road is a top 10% finisher in the 2023 Game Makers Toolkit game jam. Beware, the game is
somewhat violent!

It reverses the roles of Crossy Road, a hit mobile game where the player, a chicken,
tries to cross the road to avoid getting hit by cars.

The player plays the role of the traffic, trying to hit as many animals crossing the road as possible.

You can play it here, on [itch.io](https://andrewyx.itch.io/collidyroad).
