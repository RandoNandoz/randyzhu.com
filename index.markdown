## Greetings!

Hello, I am Randy Zhu, a student at [The University of British Columbia, Vancouver Campus (UBC)](https://ubc.ca). I am doing a few things at once (as one would) right now:

### I am working on [ExploTest](https://github.com/kliu04/explotest), along with [Kevin Liu](https://github.com/kliu04), under the supervision of [Dr. Caroline Lemieux](https://www.carolemieux.com/) at the [Software Practices Lab](https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/)

ExploTest is an automatic unit test generator that generates unit tests from end-to-end tests. It uses dynamic analysis techniques to extract out function arguments, and performs either serialization, or a (somewhat novel) code-level serialization argument reconstruction technique. I am currently working on an evaluation of its usability on real software repositories, and categorizing difficulties/challenges with test carving in Python for my honours thesis.

Previously, I held a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Undergraduate Student Research Award to work on ExploTest for the summer of 2025.
  
### Looking a 4-5 month internship/co-op for the summer of 2026!

From September 2024 to April 2025, I worked as a co-op at Teck Resources, soon to be Anglo Teck group, working on various dashboards, Power Platform apps and automations to accelerate the work of business and engineering teams. You can find a copy of my resume [here](/resume/main.pdf) and my unofficial UBC transcript (with PII redacted) [here](/assets/transcript-redacted.pdf).

### Teaching students in an [introductory computer systems course](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/course-section/cpsc-213-102-2023w)

I am a teaching assistant at UBC, teaching students the basic building blocks[^1] of software[^2]. The course covers some microarchitecture, function calling conventions, and multithreading.

[^1]: you could go down to the transistor level, of course, but I am no physicist
[^2]: not computation, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation)
